    <h2 style="color: rgb(4, 44, 4); margin-left: 30px;">WHO IS A VOTER?</h2>
    <p  style="font-size: large;">A voter is a person who has a right to participate in an election by an elector. In Nigeria, a voter is a citizen who is 18 years old and above and is duly registered whose names and details are in the register of voter. In effect, anyone who can exercise the right to vote is a voter. However, not all voters can be voted for. Anyone who contests in an election and votes is not only a voter for the purpose of that election, but also a candidate. He therefore plays a dual role at the time he is standing for an election. In the Nigerian context, such a person can only contest as a candidate on the platform or sponsorship of a political party. </p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(4, 44, 4); margin-left: 30px;">HOW CAN I BE A VOTER</h2>
        <p  style="font-size: large;"> To be registered as a voter, an individual must be:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>A citizen of Nigeria;   </li>
            <li> Has attained the age of eighteen (18) years;  </li>
            <li> Ordinarily resident, work in, originate from the Local Government Area (LGA), Council, ward covered by the registration officers of the Commission for registration as a voter;  </li>
            <li> Free from any incapacity to vote under any law in Nigeria;  </li>
            <li> Present him/herself to the registration officer of the Commission for registration as a voter; and  </li>
            <li> Must not be subject to any incapacity to vote under any law in Nigeria.  </li>
            
        </ul></p> 

<div class="container-fluid">
    <h2 style="color: rgb(4, 44, 4); margin-left: 30px;">At what age can i vote?</h2>
    <p  style="font-size: large;">In Nigeria, a voter is a citizen who is 18 years old and above and is duly registered whose names and details are in the register of voter.</p>

<div class="container-fluid">
<h2 style="color: rgb(4, 44, 4); margin-left: 30px;">How do I vote absentee?</h2>
<p  style="font-size: large;">With absentee voting — otherwise known as vote-by-mail (VBM) — you’ll receive your ballot in the mail, fill it out, and then mail it back to your state or local elections officials, rather than going to a polling place to vote.</p>

<p  style="font-size: large;">In some states, you need a valid excuse — such as being out of town on Election Day, being physically unable to go to the polls, or being stationed overseas in the military — in order to be able to vote absentee. Other states let you vote by mail without an excuse, or mail a ballot to all registered voters by default.</p>
</div>

<div class="container-fluid">
    <h2 style="color: rgb(4, 44, 4); margin-left: 30px;">Can I vote early?</h2>

    <p  style="font-size: large;">Some states allow voters to avoid the Election Day lines and cast their ballot at a more convenient time by setting up early in-person voting, where voters can go to a designated location (usually a county or city office) in the days or weeks leading up to Election Day and cast their ballot ahead of time.</p>
</div>

    <div class="container-fluid">
        <h2 style="color: rgb(4, 44, 4); margin-left: 30px;">How do I check if I'm registered to vote?</h2>

        <p  style="font-size: large;">You can check whether you’re registered to vote, as well as whether your registration address, party affiliation, etc. are up to date, using this online form from the Voter Participation Center, or check your state elections authority’s website.</p>
</div>

        <div class="container-fluid">
            <h2 style="color: rgb(4, 44, 4); margin-left: 30px;">Do I need ID to vote? If so, what type?</h2>

<p  style="font-size: large;">In some states, you need to present a valid form of identification to vote. The kinds of identification accepted vary from state to state, and some states identify you from your registration data and don’t require you to present any ID at all.</p>
</div>

<div class="container-fluid">
    <h2 style="color: rgb(4, 44, 4); margin-left: 30px;">Can I change my voting registration address online?</h2>

    <p  style="font-size: large;">If you’ve moved since you last registered to vote, you need to change your voter registration to your new address — whether you’ve moved in-town, in-state, or out-of-state. Use our online voter registration tool to register to vote at your new address.</p>
